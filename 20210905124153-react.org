Amazing. I've been learning MERN development for the last year but this was the first app I've built both front and backend together all thanks to you. I learned some very important lessons, one being that Redux is outdated thanks for function based components. Secondly this project gave me a lot of motivation and confidence. I feel so much more prepared now. Thank you
