 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
If some text is selected before the button is clicked, then the following is sent to emacs:

org-protocol://capture:/p/<url>/<title>/selection>

If nothing is selected, then instead the following is sent:

org-protocol://capture:/L/<url>/<title>

This means that you need to have appropriate capture templates for "L" and for "p".
