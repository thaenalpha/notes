* Question (0)

In my org file I have something like:

#+begin_example org
#+NAME: fig:figure
\begin{figure}
   \includegraphics{figure}
\end{figure}
#+end_example

and then I want to reference that figure inside a code block:

#+begin_example org
#+BEGIN_SRC r
    # code ...
    x <- 3
    # more code for fig. [[fig:figure]]
    plot(1:x)
#+END_SRC
#+end_example

[[fig:figure]] is not a link in the org document and does not get resolved when
exported, it simply stays verbatim in the text. Is it somehow possible to make
it reference the figure?

I think you can do it like this. They key is the mathescape option for minted,
and using minted for src block fontification.

#+begin_example org
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-minted-options
     '(("frame" "lines") ("linenos=true") ("mathescape")))
#+END_SRC

#+caption: figure for testing \label{fig-1}
[[./test.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
5
# see figure $\ref{fig-1}$
4
#+END_SRC

# Out [1]:
# text/plain

#+end_example

 Is it right that this will only work for LaTeX export, i.e., no
 link-fontification in the org-buffer and the method does not work for other
 export targets? –  Tobias Apr 30, 2019 at 14:37

 that works, pretty cool! Is it possible to set the use of minted file local? –

 I think you can use org-latex-listings to locally control which package is
 used. You want to set it to 'minted –  John Kitchin Apr 30, 2019 at 18:38

 Also this will only affect LaTeX exports. It won't fix anything in the
 org-buffer, or work for other export backends. –  John Kitchin Apr 30, 2019 at

 an even better way is the option texcl, it only works in comments but does not
 switch to the math font! –  gdkrmr May 2, 2019 at 15:11
