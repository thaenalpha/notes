Is there a function to convert between numbered and unordered lists in org-mode?
The lists may or may not be nested.

You can use the function ~org-ctrl-c-minus~, bound by default to (you guessed it)
[[kbd:][C-c -]], to cycle through the bullet types. The [[help:org-ctrl-c-minus][doctstring]] reads:

#+begin_quote helpful-mode
Insert separator line in table or modify bullet status of line.

Also turns a plain line or a region of lines into list items.
Calls ~org-table-insert-hline~, ~org-toggle-item~, or
~org-cycle-list-bullet~, depending on context.
#+end_quote

~org-cycle-list-bullet~, in turn, does the following according to the [[help:org-cycle-list-bullet][docstring]]:

    ~-~   ->  ~+~   ->  ~*~   ->  ~1.~  ->  ~1)~

See the [[elisp:(org-info-find-node "(org) Plain Lists")][org manual node on plain lists]] for more details.

In my org-mode environment, for example, the first state is as followings:
unordered list.

#+begin_example org-mode
- a
- b
- c
#+end_example

Modify the first line as "1. a" as numbered list.

#+begin_example org-mode
1. a
- b
- c
#+end_example

Now, hit [[kbd:][C-c C-c]] at the first line "1. a". Unordered list becomes numbered list.

#+begin_example org-mode
1. a
2. b
3. c
#+end_example

Modify the first line as "- a" as unordered list.

#+begin_example org-mode
- a
2. b
3. c
#+end_example

Now Hit [[kbd:][C-c C-c]] at the first line "- a". Numbered list becomes unordered list.

#+begin_example org-mode
- a
- b
- c
#+end_example

I hope it works.

You can use shiftâ†’

(that is [[kbd:][S-<right>]] in Emacs notation.) This is bound to ~org-shiftright~, which
will automatically do the right thing for your entire list if you're on any of
the items. Press it multiple times to cycle through all possible list styles.
And [[kbd:][S-<left>]] goes the other way :)
