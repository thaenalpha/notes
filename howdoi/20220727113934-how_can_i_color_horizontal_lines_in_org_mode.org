#+title: How can I color horizontal lines in org mode?
* Question (0)

Both markdown mode and Org mode allow you to insert a number of dashes on an
otherwise empty line (at least three in markdown mode, at least five in Org
mode), that are rendered as horizontal rules in the exported output.

In markdown mode, the dashes become green in the markdown buffer.

Would it be possible to obtain the same behavior in an ~org-mode~ buffer, where
the dashes become colorful?

is exported as a horizontal line.

Please see the Professor John Kitchin`s original solution from:
[[https://list.orgmode.org/87h7e5dtbb.fsf@ucl.ac.uk/T/#t][https://list.orgmode.org/87h7e5dtbb.fsf@ucl.ac.uk/T/#t]]

#+begin_quote
you can add a rule like this in an org-mode hook:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (font-lock-add-keywords
             nil
             '(("^-\\{5,\\}"  0 '(:foreground "green" :weight bold))))))
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
that will make a line starting with at least 5 - be green and bold in color.
#+end_quote
