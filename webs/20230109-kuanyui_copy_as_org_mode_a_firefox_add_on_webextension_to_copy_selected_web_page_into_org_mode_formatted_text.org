* Supported Browser

- Firefox for Desktop >= 92

* All Support Syntax

- =* Outline=, =1. ordered list=, =- unordered list=, =- [ ] GitHub style todo list=
- =| Table | Can | Be | Copied! |=
- Paragraph =<p>=, Horizontal splitter =--------=
- Quoteblock =#+begin_quote= , Codeblock ( =: one line code...= or =#+begin_src= +
  auto guess language ID. e.g. =js=, =c=, =shell= )
- =*bold*=, =/italic/=, =_underline_=, =+strike+=, ~=verbatim=~, =~code~=, =_{sub}=, =^{sup}=
- =[[link url][link title]]=, =[[a.href][img.src]]= (Notice: multiple =<img>=
  elements + other elements wrapped in =<a>= element is not supported by org-mode
  syntax. I have serveral plans as workaround for this but haven’t decided which
  one is better, hence not implemented this yet..)
- =[[imgSrc]]= (Notice: I haven’t decide how to deal with HTML =title= and =alt=
  attribute)

* Known Issues (Plegase feel free to open PR to fix them)

- Nested mark (e.g. ~*=bold and=* /=italic code=/~) may has some issues for
  org-mode renderer. This is a common usage in HTML, but may mess up the
  org-mode renderer. *This is the limitation of org-mode’s syntax & renderer, I
  cannot do anything for it* .
- Some block elements in =<a>= (e.g. =<img>=) may cannot be handled properly. *This
  is the limitation of org-mode’s syntax* .
  #+begin_quote
For example, ~<a> inner text 1 <img src="..."> another text 2 <img src="...">
another text 3 </a>~

- One of the workarounds I can think up so far is to split each Node and make
  each of them an independent links, but looks disgusting… Like =[[url][inner
  text 1]] [[url][imgsrc]] [[url][another text 2]] [[url][imgsrc]]
  [[url][another text 3]]= ….
- Or use ~#+HTML: <a href="url">~ and =#+HTML:</a>= to wrap the children contents
  and elements. However, this will make the =<a>= to a block element and create
  unneeded inevitable new lines.
  #+end_quote

- =<pre>= may lost newlines in some page (e.g.
  [[https://kuanyui.github.io/2017/08/16/macros-for-qproperty/][https://kuanyui.github.io/2017/08/16/macros-for-qproperty/]]). Should be fixed
  now but I cannot sure.
- Notification may freeze the whole Firefox *when using on Linux* (Test on Firefox
  92, Ubuntu & Manjaro), but such issue seems not occurs on Firefox for Windows.
  So I make this feature an optional setting, you can enable it manually.
