#+title: Emacs

* [2021-07-19 Mon] These resources will help you as you continue on your Emacs journey:

 * The Emacs Manual provides excellent, comprehensive instructions. Spend some time with it every morning! Download the PDF and read it on the go: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html#Top.
 * The Emacs Reference Card is a handy cheat sheet: http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~helio/disciplinas/MC102/Emacs_Reference_Card.pdf.
 * Mastering Emacs by Mickey Petersen is one of the best Emacs resources available. Start with the reading guide: http://www.masteringemacs.org/reading-guide/.
 * For the more visually minded folks, I recommend the hand-drawn “How to Learn Emacs: A Beginner’s Guide to Emacs 24 or Later” by Sacha Chua: http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs8.png.
